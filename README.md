# DRMBM remake CS coursework project

This repository contains all the work I did on my A-level coursework project. To summarise, it was supposed to be a remake of DRMBM, but I took on a project that was too big to complete in the timeframe, so it is unfinished. Still, it contains useful code and was a valuable learning experience. You can find more information in the report PDF.
